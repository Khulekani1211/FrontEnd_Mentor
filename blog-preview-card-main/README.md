## My process

My process focuses on mobile first design. So I began by working on the mobile display. However, considering the fact that the blog-preview card is small enough to fit into the suggested mobile screen size of 375px, there was no need to add responsiveness through @media queries.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

My main take aways from this challenge has to do with centering a div correctly and how using CSS  variables for colors makes one's CSS look better and readable.

### Continued development

I plan on creating a personal blog site and this challenge has helped with an idea for how to have my blog posts previewed. A card preview instead of a simple title and description is more aesthetically appealing.

### Useful resources

- [Perfect Pixel - chrome extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/perfectpixel-by-welldonec/dkaagdgjmgdmbnecmcefdhjekcoceebi) - This helped with getting the acurate dimensions of the blog-preview card in the design.
