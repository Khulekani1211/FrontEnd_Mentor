## My process
I generally prefer to focus on mobile first design, that way it is easier to deal with media queries as the screen gets bigger. For this project however, the mobile screen is 375px and the component appears perfect even in the large scrren size of 1440px. 

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS
- Flexbox to center the component
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Styled Components](https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Outfit:wght@400;700&display=swap) - For the font type

### What I learned

I learnt how to center the component with the use of flex in the styling of the body element.
Below is how I achieved the centering of the component:

```css
body{
  font-family: Outfit;
  background-color: hsl(212, 45%, 89%);
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  height: 100vh;
}
```

### Useful resources

- [W3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_align.asp) - This helped me  with centering the component. It also shed light on how to center items in a div.
