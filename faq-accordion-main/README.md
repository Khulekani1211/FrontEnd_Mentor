## Overview
We are required to recreate a front end FAQ component from FrontEndMentor.io.
There are two designs to consider when completing the challenge, i.e., the mobile design and the desktop design.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Hide/Show the answer to a question when the question is clicked
- Navigate the questions and hide/show answers using keyboard navigation alone
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

My process involves mobile first design principles. Regarding this particular project, I used the suggested mobile screen width of 375px, and did not cater for screens with a smaller width. For desktop layouts I sticked to the recommended 1440px and not for larger screen layouts.

The solution is responsive for screen widths between 375px and 1440px.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Sass
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/components/accordion/) - CSS Library, for Accordions.

### What I learned

This was my first real intro into Bootstrap. I installed it via npm so that I could have flexibility to change the styling of the acordions to match the styling in the challenge.

I found using Bootstrap 5 made the development process so much easier. I didn't have to write a lot of JavaScript and I didn't have to write a lot of CSS.

### Continued development

I plan on using Bootstrap for future front end projects. Diving deeper into this CSS Library to create more seamless front end designs.

### Useful resources

- [Bootstrap 5 Official Site](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/components/accordion/) - This helped me with creating the accordion functionality without writing any JavaScript for it.
- [ByteGrad Youtube Channels](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPAiTlQr7no) - This is an amazing Youtube channel through which I learned how to install Bootstrap via NPM and how to customize styling. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
